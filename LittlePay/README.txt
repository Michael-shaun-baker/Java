Instructions

Run the java file, the csv file is contained inside the folder, with a mix of complete, Incomplete and Cancelled journeys.
To input your own csv, change the read in location in the code. 

Assumptions

The code assumes that all the relevent data is included in the csv file.
It can take in, an unsorted csv file. ie. the ID is unsorted.
The Comapny and BusID were not changed as it would require inputting new cost for a different route so for this demonstration they will be all the same.
